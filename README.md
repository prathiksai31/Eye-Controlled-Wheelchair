# Eye Controlled Wheelchair

The idea is to create an Eye Controlled System which enables the
movement of the patient’s wheelchair depending on the movements of
eyeball. A person suffering from quadriplegia can move his eyes and
partially tilt his head, thus giving an opportunity for detecting these
movements.
